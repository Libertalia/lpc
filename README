Instanciate on OpenShift:

    rhc app-create python-2.7 cron-1.4 postgresql-9.2 \
        -a prod
        -e OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WSGI_APPLICATION=src/lpc/wsgi.py \
		--from-code https://github.com/libertalia/lpc.git \
		--no-git

Note: libsass won't compile on openshift because it has gcc 4.4, effects:

- it's not installed in requirements,
- we pre-build and version static files in wsgi/static/collected
